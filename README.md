# React Router Dom - Missing Route Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 and above where a missing route definition can lead to unexpected routing behavior.  The application fails to render the expected component when navigating to a path without a defined route.

## Bug Description

The provided `App.js` includes routes for '/' and '/about'. However, it's missing a route for '/users'. Navigating to '/users' results in an empty page or error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the fix: adding a Route component for the '/users' path.
